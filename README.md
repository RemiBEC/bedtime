bedtime
=======

Control the bedtime of your children by automatically disconnecting their devices from your Internet connection.

It does this by replacing your ISP router as the source of IP addresses, which allows it to learn all the devices on your network and control their access. Parents can log into a web interface, link devices to children and set their bedtimes for school nights and weekends. Misbehaving children can be grounded or children's access can be extended as a reward.

Packages are available from http://sf.net/projects/bedtime/files
